   session history, and browsers cap that (roughly 640KB-2MB) — a parsed CSV near
   our 40MB upload limit can blow past it and throw. A plain module variable has
   no such cap, and a hard refresh re-executes this module, so `pending` is `null`
   again for free — the exact fallback /analyze needs with no prior upload. */

   see null and break in dev only. Left set until the next real upload overwrites
   it, or a reload wipes it. */
